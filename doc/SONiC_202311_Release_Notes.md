# Feature List

| Feature| Feature Description | HLD PR / PR tracking |	Quality |
| ------ | ------- | -----|-----|
| ***[DASH] ACL tags HLD*** | In a DASH SONiC, a service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes from a given service. The controller manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change, minimizing the complexity of frequent updates to network security rules. Mapping a prefix to a tag can reduce the repetition of prefixes across different ACL rules and optimize memory usage. | [1427](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/pull/1427) | |
| ***AMD-Pensando ELBA SOC support*** | This patchset adds support for AMD-Pensando ELBA SOC. Elba provides a secure, controlled portal to network services, storage, and the data center control plane. This SOC is used in AMD-Pensando PCI Distributed Services Card (DSC).| [322](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-linux-kernel/pull/322) | |
| ***Auto FEC*** | This feature delivers a deterministic approach when FEC and autoneg are configured together which is currently left to vendor implementation. | [1416](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/pull/1416)	 | |
| ***Banner HLD*** | This feature covers the definition, design and implementation of SONiC Banner feature and Banner CLI. |[1361](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/pull/1361)| |
| ***BGP Unnumberd- enable Multiple sessions and assign unique MAC address per port by default*** | This feature is achieved with the implementation of new FRR 8.5.1 integration | [15965](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/pull/15965) | |
| ***Container Hardening*** | This feature implements the container hardening, containing the security hardening requirements and definitions for all containers on top of SONiC | [1364](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/pull/1364) |  |
| ***Egress Sflow Enhancement.*** | This feature updates the existing sFlow HLD for egress Sflow support. | [1268](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/pull/1268) | |
| ***Factory reset*** | This feature implements the support for reset factory feature in Sonic OS. | [1231](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/pull/1231) |  |
| ***Fix containers deployments dependencies on boot/config_reload affecting user experience*** | Currently hostcfgd controls the services based on the feature table. The feature table has a specific field 'has_timer' for the non essential services which needs to be delayed during the reboot flow. This field will be now replaced by new field called "delayed". These services will controlled by hostcfgd. | [1203](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/pull/1203) & [1379](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/issues/1379) | |	
| ***High-level design for Wake-on-LAN feature in SONiC*** | This feature implements the Wake-on-LAN feature design in SONiC. Wake-on-LAN (WoL or WOL) is an Ethernet or Token Ring computer networking standard that allows a computer to be turned on or awakened from sleep mode by a network message.  | [1508](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/pull/1508) |  |
| ***Libvs Port Counter Support*** | TBD | [1398](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/issues/1398) | |
| ***NAT Bookworm Upgrade*** | This feature updates the fullcone NAT patch in sonic-linux-kernel needs to be updated for Linux 6.1. | [1519](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/issues/1519), [16867](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/issues/16867) &  [357](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-linux-kernel/pull/357) | |
| ***PDDF System Fan Enhancement*** | Current PDDF design supports only 12 individual fans (if 2 fans per tray then total of 6 fantrays). However, some platform have more fans. To support those platforms via PDDF, we added support for more fans in common fan PDDF drivers. | [15956](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/pull/15956) & [1440](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/issues/1440) | |
| ***PDDF support for Ufispace platforms and GPIO extension*** | This feature adds the PDDF support on Ufispace platforms with Broadcom ASIC for S9110-32X, S8901-54XC, S7801-54XS, S6301-56ST | [16017](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/pull/16017) & [1441](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/issues/1441)| |
| ***Persistent DNS address across reboots*** | With the current implementation dynamic DNS configuration can be received from the DHCP server or static configuration can be set manually by the user. However, SONiC doesn't provide any protection for the static configuration. The configuration that is set by the user can be overwritten with the dynamic configuration at any time. The proposed solution is to add support for static DNS configuration into Config DB. To be able to choose between dynamic and static DNS configurations resolvconf package. | [1380](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/issues/1380), [13834](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/pull/13834), [14549](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/pull/14549), [2737](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-utilities/pull/2737), [49](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-host-services/pull/49), [1322](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/pull/1322), [8436](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/pull/8436) & [8712](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/pull/8712) | |
| ***RADIUS NSS Vulnerability*** | TBD | [1399](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/issues/1399) | |
| ***SSH global config*** | This feature introduces a procedure to configure ssh server global settings. This feature will include 3 configurations in the first phase, but can be extended easily to include additional configurations. | [1169](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/issues/1169), [1075](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/pull/1075) | |
| ***Sflow 800G Support*** | This feature enhances the current sFlow in sonic, with additional speed due to new ASICs support for 800G. | [1383](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/issues/1383), [2799](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-swss/pull/2799) & [2805](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-swss/pull/2805) | |
| ***TACACS NSS Vulnerability*** | TBD | [1464](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/issues/1464) | |
| ***UMF Infra Enhancement for SONIC-YANG*** | This implements the option to import specific sonic yangs from buildimage sonic-yang-models directory into UMF & CVL enhancement to handle handle singleton tables modeled as a container instead of the usual _LIST syntax | [1397](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/issues/1397) | |
| ***UMF Subscription Infra Phase 2*** | This feature implements the  SONiC Telemetry service and Translib infrastructure changes to support gNMI subscriptions and wildcard paths for YANG defined paths. |  [1287](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/pull/1287) | |
